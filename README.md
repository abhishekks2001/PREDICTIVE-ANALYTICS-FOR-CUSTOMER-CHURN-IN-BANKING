# PREDICTIVE-ANALYTICS-FOR-CUSTOMER-CHURN-IN-BANKING

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project utilizes predictive analytics to address customer churn in the banking sector. With a dataset comprising 10,000 rows and 17 columns, the objective is to develop a robust model capable of predicting when a customer might leave the bank. Leveraging machine learning, particularly the Random Forest Classifier, various customer attributes such as credit scores, demographics, and tenure are analyzed to identify trends associated with churn. The model achieves an accuracy score of 87.15%, enabling proactive measures to retain customers through tailored programs and improved services. This initiative empowers banks to preemptively address customer attrition, enhancing competitiveness and bolstering customer satisfaction in the dynamic banking landscape.
